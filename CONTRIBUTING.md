## Conventional Commits quick-start

We use the Conventional Commits standard with imperative tense for all commits. Keep each commit focused and describe **why** the change is needed.

Example format:

```
fix(module): brief summary

Prior to this commit, ...

In this commit, ...
```

Refer to `AGENTS.md` for detailed templates and guidelines.
